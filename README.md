# A scalable deep reinforcement learning method for virtual autonomous racing on F1tenth environment

This project builds a wrapper for [f1tenth gym simulator](https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_gym) and uses 
[RLLib](https://www.ray.io/rllib) to train deep reinforcement learning models at scale.

## Installation

This project is tested on python 3.8

First Install f1tenth gym environment from [here](https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_gym)

Install Rllib from [here](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/rllib/index.html)

clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/navidmdn/f1tenth_rl.git
```

Install required libraries:
```
    cd f1tenth_rl
    pip install requirements.txt
```
